\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented a comprehensive study on optimizing AI systems. We proposed a new framework that integrates advanced preprocessing and a modified neural network architecture.

Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Future work will focus on extending this framework to distributed computing environments and exploring its applicability to other domains.
