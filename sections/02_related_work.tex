\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}
In this section, we review the existing literature relevant to our study. Several approaches have been proposed to solve similar problems.

\subsection{Traditional Methods}
Early research focused on rule-based systems. Smith et al. \cite{b1} proposed a method based on heuristic rules, which showed promise in controlled environments but lacked robustness in dynamic settings.

\subsection{Deep Learning Approaches}
With the advent of deep learning, many researchers have turned to neural networks. Jones et al. \cite{b2} introduced a convolutional neural network architecture that significantly improved accuracy. However, their method requires a large amount of labeled data, which is not always available.

Our work builds upon these foundations but introduces a semi-supervised learning mechanism to mitigate the data dependency issue.
